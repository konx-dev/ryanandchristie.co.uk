# ryanandchristie.co.uk - wedding website

Built with Gatsby.js (React) and hosted with Netlify. Features a form submission for confirming RSVP's, details of the date and venue and anything else required by the client.


**Oliver went above and beyond with our wedding website. From drafting out the initial pages to final detailing and revisions, he was helpful, knowledgeable and was able to take our input and weave it into exactly what we wanted. The resulting website was great - better than we were hoping for. The RSVP forms have allowed us to plan easily, and our guests kept commenting how nice it looked and how simple it was for them to respond.** 

**I'd recommend Oliver's services to anyone. He delivered us a great website that we really felt a part of.**
Client - Ryan Hunt (2018)
